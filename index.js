//PROPOSED GAME LOGIC


// -> All pieces are represented by their respective classes.
// -> Thier instances will contain all info about them (position, direction anol)
// -> The grid will be a grid, containing "divs" as individual cells.
// -> the information in the game state will keep on updating the cells of the grid 
// accordingly




class Game {
    //This might be the instance of the game to store the full game state.
    //this might be useful in hacker++ in loading a saved game 
}



class Player {
    // This will store the positions, stats and all for the each class.
    // Two instances will be spawned for two player mode
}
